# Why become sponsor?

Snowcamp is organized by a group of geeky volonteers. Their only motivation is to propose a unique conference gathering innovation and research.
To make a success of this adventure, we need you.
In return, we offer you a large visibility, on the web and during the event. It's the perfect opportunity to meet developers from Grenoble, demonstrate your products and services, and to make yourself known.

# Beer at Meet & Greet

For the friendly Meet & Greet moment, the Thursday from 4:50 PM to 6:00 PM, one of the Etoile sponsors can take care of distributing beer and soft drinks. The idea:

- Distribute beer at their booth only during the Meet & Greet time slot (not during the 2 days).
- The distribution involves draft beer (no bottles or cans). Therefore, a tap, beer kegs, and eco-cups for 600 people need to be arranged.
- The benefit for the sponsor is to ensure traffic to their booth :-).
- The counterpart, of course, is to organize this: logistics, beer distribution, rental fees for the tap, purchase of kegs, rental of eco-cups...

# Inscription

The registration process has 2 steps:

1. Since the open date of the sponsoring campaign, you can use the online form to register your company.
For the Etoile sponsor, this registratrion sets your ranking and therefore the booth.
2. After the registration step the Snowcamp organisation team sends you an invoice by email Since the reception of the invoice, the sponsor has 90 days to make the payment.
After that delay, the snowcamp organisation has the right to cancel the contract with that sponsor and to replace this sponsor.
